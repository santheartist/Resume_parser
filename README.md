# 💼 Resume Parser App (Flask + OpenAI + Bootstrap)

## 🧠 Objective  
The Resume Parser App allows recruiters and job seekers to evaluate resumes using AI. Upload a PDF resume and specify a target profession (e.g., "Backend Developer") — the app will parse the resume and assess the candidate using OpenAI GPT-3.5.  
It provides a detailed breakdown of:  
- Contact information  
- Work experience  
- Skills (technical + soft)  
- An AI-powered evaluation (score, recommendation, proceed/no decision)  
> Built with Flask, OpenAI, Bootstrap 5, and modern UI/UX design.
